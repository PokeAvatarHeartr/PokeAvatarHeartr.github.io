        <p class="funky-text">Hi! My name is Rachel, though on the internet, people call me either Korrena Mayonaka or PokeAvatarHeartr.
            </p>
        <p class="funky-text">I like: the colour blue, monkeys, music, videogames, anime, video editing, animating, drawing and nail art.
            </p>
           <p class="funky-text">I wanted to join GirlsInnov8 because it sounded like so much fun and I wanted to know more about coding (which I hadn't actually done before).
            </p>
        <p class="funky-text">My profile picture on a lot of accounts looks like this. (I never post a real picture of myself on the internet.)</p>
